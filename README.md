# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

Summary of the Project:
For this project I was tasked with implementing a temperature sensor on a CC3220S microcontroller launchpad that lets the user set the temperature and once the temperature is reach the LED light will turn off. The temperature is checked every second and is displayed along with the desired temperature, heat status, and total time of activation. The user can click two buttons to either increase or decrease the desired temperature and the system will recognize if the temperature is met or not. 

What did you do particularly well?
Implementing the button and temperature sensor to work together was something I believe I did very well. The buttons helped set the desired temperature and implementing that with the temperature sensor was something I did very well. 

Where could you improve?
Creating the interrupts to work correctly with the timer is something I wish I would have spent more time learning and implementing, this would have made the system much more functional. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Some of the website I have used is something I plan on adding to my support networks. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The most difficult thing about this project is implementing the concepts into C++ and the devices specific calls and functions. I will use this experience when developing other projects and make sure to understand the code along with the standards of the systems before I create the system. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Keeping the project updated on the concepts helps maintain the system and adding more in line code makes the system much more readable. To keep it updatable I make sure to use code that can be used in other scenarios and not getting too difficult helps makes the system more adaptable.
